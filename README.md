# cli-maze
Command line based maze rendering for Linux
This software is inspired by CommandLineFPS:
https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS
or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw

The goal is to propese pretty much identical software although instead using Windows API 
it provides support for Linux by implementing terminal controls over ncurses library.

Running
1. Install ncurses lib.
2. Set the terminal to xterm.
export TERM=xterm
3. For good impression set your terminal deafult geometry to 120x40.
